                Hi there! I am an engineer. You might ask me what am I doing here ? Let me tell you this :
                Iâ€™ve studied computer programming and web development . To get here, I only followed my passions :  Programming.

                </Grid>
                <Grid item className={classes.typographyText}>
                <Typography  align='center' variant="body1" paragraph>
                I started by coding desktop application and web application, Then after having following many GEEK coder and my experience in a company,
                I started to code by structured strategies and resolve many  issues that  gave me more confidence. This area has developed my analytical skills.

                 </Grid>
                 <Grid item className={classes.typographyText}>
                <Typography  align='center' variant="body1" paragraph>
                I started Web development with spring boot , because I was a java  fanatic :p.
                I needed the web development to prototype my ideas and make them real. I was finally
                convinced by the Nodejs environment whether in frontend or backend, which drove me into the world of JavaScript and made me even more passionate than ever. 
                </Typography>  
                 </Grid>
                 <Grid item className={classes.typographyText}>
                <Typography  align='center' variant="body1" paragraph>
                This combo has made me a Full-stack developer, who can integrate the advantage
                of the java language and its incredible libraries at the service of the NodeJS APIs and ReactJS and angular interfaces.
